## Text Classification Case Study


#### My Goal

The goal of this case study is to build a model that identifies which mobile phone apps are related to fitness.

#### The Data

* one file contains text descriptions for 2500+ mobile phone apps
* one file contains the labels indicating if the app is a fitness app or not

#### Results

My final model had a ROC AUC score of 97.5% on the test data. This means that given one true positive and one true negative, my model would correctly predict that the fitness-app is more likely to be a fitness app compared to the not-fitness app 96% of the time.

The top 20 word-roots in the descriptions that indicated a fitness-related app were (in order):

 - workout
 - exercis
 - fit
 - app
 - train
 - bodi (body, bodies, etc)
 - weight
 - track
 - use
 - calori
 - time
 - muscl
 - get
 - run
 - health
 - calcul
 - help
 - program
 - diet
 - yoga
 - applic
 - daili
 - fat
 - food
 - activ

 For the most part, these words make sense as the top words.
