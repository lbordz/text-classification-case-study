## Text Classification Case Study


#### My Goal

The goal of this case study is to build a model that identifies which mobile phone apps are related to fitness.

#### The Data

* one file contains text descriptions for 2500+ Android apps
* one file contains the labels indicating if the app is a fitness app or not

#### Results

My final model had a ROC AUC score of 96% on the test data. This means that given one true positive and one true negative, my model would correctly predict that the fitness-app is more likely to be a fitness app compared to the not-fitness app 96% of the time.
